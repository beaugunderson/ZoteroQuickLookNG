ZoteroQuickLookNG
=================

This open source project implements QuickLook in Zotero.

# History

This is a fork of the excellent work done by
[@mronkko](https://github.com/mronkko),
[@bwiernik](https://github.com/bwiernik), and others on
[ZoteroQuickLook](https://github.com/mronkko/ZoteroQuickLook).

I only use Zotero on macOS so support for Windows and Linux has been removed.
  If there is demand I can add it back or help interested parties open a Pull
  Request.

# Installing

To install ZoteroQuickLook, download the latest version of
`zoteroquicklook.xpi` from the Releases section of this GitHub repo. In
**Zotero** open Tools -> Add-ons. Then drag the `zoteroquicklook.xpi` file onto
the Zotero Add-ons window.
